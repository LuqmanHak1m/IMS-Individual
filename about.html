    <p>Hello, my name is Muhamad Luqman Hakim Bin Abdullah. I am 22 years old. I was born in 22 August 2002 in Kota Bharu, Kelantan and I lived in Pasir Mas, Kelantan. I am the youngest in my family and i have one sister. My father works as a policeman in Pasir Mas, Kelantan while my mother is a housewife.</p>

      Everybody has different hobbies that they like to do for fun or just to relax. There are many kind of activities like badminton, basketball, swimming or playing rugby. It all depends on each personality. For me, playing futsal is my favorite hobby because it’s part of my life and I can not live without it. Since I was a little boy, I started to play futsal in the school team and also with my friends in the neighborhood. My mother told me that I liked kicking the ball around and had so much fun with it when I was only about 5 years old. Since then, playing futsal is my favorite sport and it is my hobby whenever I have free time. Futsal serves as more than just a hobby. For me, it is a source of relaxation and confidence, particularly when I'm dealing with stress and frustration. For example, after completing assignments or returning from classes, I often join my friends in a game outside my house, or we head to the field when the weather is favorable. This activity not only provides a refreshing break but also instills a sense of assurance in me during challenging times.</P>
      
      Furthermore, As a fresh graduate from marketing course, my future plans likely revolve around pursuing a career in the dynamic and ever-evolving field of marketing. For example, brand manager. Brand manager is a marketing professional responsible for overseeing and developing the brand identity of a product or company. As a brand manager, I can work to build and mantain a strong brand image for a product or company, developing marketing strategies and campaigns to enhance brand recognition.</p>
